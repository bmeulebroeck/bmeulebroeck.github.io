<p>Hello, my name is Brent Meulebroeck. I am a student in the Data Vizualization Boot Camp through the University of Minnesota. 
  I am married and have two dogs, Hedwig and Dogtor Venkman. I live in Eden Prairie, MN.
</p>
<p>
  I have worked in retail management for 20 years with companies such as Target, Midwest Supplies/Northern Brewer, and Goodwill-Easter Seals MN. 
  I have always been drawn to the 'numbers' and financials of the business, and making that information accessible to other leaders in my organization is what drew me to this boot camp.
</p>
